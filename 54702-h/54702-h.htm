<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Octavia is the only extant tragedy in fabula
praetexta or historical Roman tragedy in Roman scene and setting.
It is remarkably true to fact, and almost every statement may be
verified by reference to the ancient historians.</p>

<p>It deals with the sad story of Octavia, the daughter
of Claudius and Messalina. Married against her will when
only twelve years old to Nero, a lad of sixteen, she was after
five years divorced by her husband on a charge of barrenness in
favor of Poppaea Sabina, and in 62 A.D. was banished to a desert
island there to be executed.</p>

<p>The play is a well rounded whole, all the parts
are well worked out, and the characters are vivid and lifelike.
There is a force and majesty in the tragedy which carries the
reader through without pause. The sad story of Octavia forms the
plot, but the poet has interwoven political motives and represents
the people as taking Octavia’s part. This only serves to hasten
her death, for Nero eagerly seizes upon this as a pretext to condemn
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>There are five acts in the play, and each is closed
by chants from the chorus which serve to explain the action
further. There are many references to history and mythology, but
the atmosphere is distinctly Roman. At no time do three actors
appear on the stage in the same scene. The characters are exactly
as one would expect from a close study of history and are delineated
with marvelous skill and fidelity.</p>

<p>The versification is confined to iambic meters in
the dialogues, while the choruses, though they form a very prominent
feature, are restricted to anapestic systems somewhat loosely
constructed.</p>

<p>The play is really a bitter impeachment of Nero
and was composed shortly after his death in 68 A.D. The tragedy
of Octavia for a long time was supposed to be written by Seneca
and was handed down to posterity with his genuine dramas, but
later authorities ascribe its authorship possibly to Curiatius
<a id="ref_3">Maternus</a>. There is unmistakable evidence in the words of the
play that it was composed after Nero’s death, and this would render
the authorship of Seneca entirely out of the question since
he died three years before Nero.</p>

<p>There is perceptible the strong influence of
Greek tragedy, but the plot and setting are distinctly original.
Octavia has the characteristics of tragedy as laid down by Aristotle,
that the aim is to purify the passions by means of action
exciting pity for the actors and fear for the hearers, and that
the leading characters must partly occasion their own misfortunes.
Octavia conforms to the old Greek idea of the unities of
time, place, and action. The place of action is confined to the
palace of Nero; the action may be considered as taking place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
one day and night; and the action forms a whole of which each
part has its proper place and the parts follow one another in
logical order.</p>

<h2>OCTAVIA, A TRAGEDY.</h2>


<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Already glorious Aurora<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> chases the wandering
stars from the sky. Titan,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with radiant hair, rises and
returns a clear day to the world. Come, thou<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who art burdened
by so many great misfortunes, utter once more thy sad lamentations.
Surpass the kingfishers<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the swift nightingales, for thy
fate is more grievous than theirs. O, mother, for whom I have
always mourned, the first cause of my misfortunes, (if any consciousness
exists in the shades) hear the sad lamentations of thy
daughter. Would that Clotho<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> had broken my threads with her
own aged hand before I saw thy features sprinkled with loathsome
blood.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> O, day always fatal to me, from that time thou hast been
to me more hateful than the lower regions. I have endured commands, hostility, and
fierce glances from my cruel stepmother.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
That gloomy Erinys<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has brought to my bridal room Stygian<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
fires and has destroyed thee, wretched father,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> whom recently
the whole world beyond the Ocean obeyed, before whom retreated
the Britains,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ignorant of our leaders and their own rights.
Woe to me, father, that I am overwhelmed by the treachery of thy
wife, and that thou liest prostrate, and that thy conquered home
and daughter obey the tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: If anyone is captivated, astonished, and stupefied
by the first gleam of deceptive royalty, he will see, overthrown
by a sudden attack of concealed Fortune, a recently powerful
home and the progeny of Claudius who ruled the world and
commanded the ocean which reluctantly received his fleets.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Behold, he who first placed the yoke upon the Britains<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and covered
unknown seas with such great fleets, and was safe among barbarous
tribes and savage seas, perished by his wife’s crime.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Soon she died by the hand of her own son whose brother met death
by poison. The unhappy sister and wife sorrows; restrained indignation
cannot conceal the grievous affliction of a cruel husband
whom she in her innocence always escapes, while the passionate
husband burns with a mutual hatred. In vain my fidelity and loyalty
to soothe her sorrowing mind. Pitiless grief frustrates my
plans; the mind’s generous ardor cannot be subdued but gathers
strength for evils. Alas, what an infamous crime our terror foresees.
O, may the gods avert it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: My fortunes are comparable to no evils,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> even if
I should recall thy sorrows, Electra.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Thou wast permitted
to mourn thy father and to avenge the crime by the vengeance of
a brother whom thy loyalty rescued and thy fidelity protected.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Fear prevents me from lamenting my parents removed by a cruel
destiny, and forbids me to weep for the death of a brother who
had been my only hope and the brief solace for so many misfortunes.
Now I remain in my sorrow the shadow of a great name.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Listen, I hear the voice of my sad foster daughter.
Does slow old age hesitate to <a id="ref_11"></a>go to the wedding chamber?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: O, nurse, thou faithful witness of my grief,
see my tears.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: What day, wretched daughter, will free thee from
such sorrow?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: The day which will send me to the Stygian
shades.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: I hope that these forebodings of thine may be
long in realization.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Not thy prayers but the fates rule my destiny.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: A pitying god will give better opportunities
to thee in thy sorrow. Soon thou wilt quietly win over thy husband
with caressing obedience.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: I could conquer the savage lion and the fierce tiger
sooner than the merciless heart of a barbarous tyrant. He hates
men of noble descent, he scorns both gods and men, and not yet
does he meet the fate which his infamous mother by a dreadful
crime bestowed upon him. Although he may be ashamed to have gained
this unacknowledged empire by the kindness of his ill-omened
mother, yet she will bear this title of honor<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> after death
for endless generations.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Restrain the thoughts of thy raging mind; repress
those rashly spoken words.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: However much I may endure the inevitable, never
can my misfortunes be ended except by sorrowful death. With a
mother murdered and a father removed through crime, deprived of a
brother, overwhelmed by my woes and grief, distasteful to my husband, and
submissive to my slaves, I do not enjoy a pleasant life.
My heart is always trembling, not from fear of death&mdash;to die would
be a joy&mdash;but from dread of crime<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of which I hope I may
never be accused. For it is a punishment worse than death for me
in my misery to see those swollen features and to endure the
fierce glances of a tyrant<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the kisses of an enemy, not even
whose courteous nod I cannot endure after the murder of my brother<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whose
empire the wicked assassin rules and over which he
rejoices. How often the sorrowful apparition of my brother appears
to my vision when quiet relaxes my limbs and sleep weighs
down my eyes wearied by weeping. Now he arms his feeble hands
with smoky torches and with hostile intent seeks the presence
of his own brother;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> now in fear and trembling he flees into
my apartment; his enemy follows and violently pierces us with his
sword as we cling together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Then tremulous dread drives away sleep and renews my wretched
sorrow and fear. Besides all these woes, there is the haughty
mistress<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> resplendent with the spoils of our home&mdash;the mistress
whose son rewarded her by placing her upon that fatal bark.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
More cruel than the waves of the sea, he destroyed<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> her by
his sword after the failure of the shipwreck in the peaceful
waters. After such a great crime, how can I hope to escape? A victorious
and unfriendly woman<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> threatens my marriage couch.
Burning with hatred toward me, she demands, as a reward for her
dishonor, the head of the lawful wife. Come forth from the shades
and aid thy appealing daughter, father,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> or open the Stygian depths
to the sundered earth whither I may be borne headlong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: In vain, wretched daughter, dost thou invoke the
spirit of thy father who in the lower world has no thought for
his child. He could prefer the progeny of foreign blood<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to
his own son and he married in disgraceful nuptials the daughter
of his own brother.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> From thence is begun a long series of
crime, murder, treachery, desire for dominion, and thirst for royal
blood. The noble son-in-law<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> was betrayed by his wife’s father
and perished in the bridal chamber lest he become powerful by
his union with thee. Alas, that such a crime should be! Silanus, given
as a reward to Agrippina who falsely accused him, has
taken his own life. Then there entered the conquered home the
hostile son-in-law<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and yet an own son, a youth of infamous
genius, capable of any crime, and influenced by the wily stepmother
who gave him to thee in marriage although thou wast timid
and reluctant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>This fierce and victorious woman, carried away by her great success, has
dared to menace the sacred empire of the world. Who can
recall the many crimes, and infamous desires, and beguiling treachery
of a woman who seeks power through the steps of every
crime? Then sacred Loyalty fled with trembling step; cruel Erinys
with deadly tread entered the deserted halls, polluted with baneful
fires the sacred Penates, violated Justice, and broke every
law of Nature. The unnatural wife mixed poison for her husband; he
perished; then soon, she, too, fell by the hand of her own son.
Thou, too, art fallen, Britannicus, unhappy youth whom we forever
mourn, recently the star of the universe and the protector of a
mighty home; now, woe to me, thou art only light ashes and a sorrowful
shade. Even the cruel stepmother shed tears when I placed
thy body upon the funeral pyre and when the cruel flame played
round thy godlike limbs and features.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Let it destroy me too lest this tyrant perish
by my hand.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Nature has not given such strength to thee.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Grief, sadness, misery, anguish, and mourning will
give it.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Thou hadst better conquer pitiless Nero by obedience.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: For what purpose? That he may restore to me
my brother whom he has murdered?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: That thou, thyself, mayst be safe; that thou by thy
progeny, mayst keep from ruin the former home of thy father.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: The home of the emperor desires another offspring.
The dreadful death of my brother distracts me.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Such great favor of the citizens toward him
should soothe thy mind.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: It alleviates my sorrows but does not free
me from them.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: The power of the people is great.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: But the power of the ruler is greater.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: He will have regard for his wife.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: His mistress forbids this.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: But as everyone knows, she is hated by all.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: But dear to my husband.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Not yet his wife, however.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Soon she will be a wife and at the same time
a mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Youthful ardor rages at first but easily languishes
just as the warmth of a little flame; not long does it
continue in disgraceful love, but unceasing love for a chaste wife
remains. The first slave<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who dared to dishonor thy couch long
swayed the emperor’s mind, but now she fears&mdash;</p>

The sailors are ordered to leave the peaceful port; the
waves resound with the measured beat of the oars. The ship is
borne along upon the deep seas; sinking slowly, it suddenly divides
and sucks in the waters. A great clamor mingled with women’s
wailing is raised to the stars; a dreadful death threatens them; each
one seeks for himself escape from death; some cling to the
planks of the shattered stern; their naked bodies cleave the waves; others
swim for the shore; the fates plunge many to the depths of
the sea. Augusta rends her clothing; she tears her hair and weeps.
After she has given up hope of escape, burning with wrath and overcome
by her misfortune, she exclaims, “Dost thou reward me, thus, for
my great services, my son? I confess that I am worthy of this
ship since I gave birth to thee, and in my madness gave thee life, dominion, and
the royal name of Caesar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>“Lift thy face from the lower world, husband, and feast upon my
punishment. The cause of thy death, Claudius, and the instigator
of thy son’s funeral pyre, I shall be borne to Tartarus, deservedly
unburied and overwhelmed by the savage waters of the sea.” As
she spoke, the waves beat her face, she rises again from the waters; in
terror, she beats the billows with her palms but finally exhausted
she yields to the struggle. Loyalty still remained in silent
hearts though scorned even in the hour of bitter death. Many hasten
to aid their mistress whose strength is broken by the force of
the sea. With shouts they encourage her as she slowly but persistently
waves her arms. Eagerly they lift her into their boat. What
did it profit thee to escape the waters of the cruel sea? Thou art
destined to die by the sword of thy son whose infamous crime posterity will
scarcely believe and to which succeeding generations
will always be slow to give credence. The unnatural son is furious
at his mother’s escape, he grieves that she is saved from the
sea, and he commits a greater crime by hastening her death. The
servant sent to commit the murder lays open the breast of the
mother with his sword. The unhappy woman, while dying, commands the
slave to bury the fierce sword in her womb. “Here, here is the
place. The sword must pierce the womb which bore such a monster.”
Then, passionately weeping, she breathed her last.</p>

<p>The maiden Justice, the goddess of divine majesty, sent with sacred
Piety from heaven, mercifully ruled the human race. The nations had
not known wars, nor the fierce blasts of the trumpets, nor arms; they
did not surround their cities with walls; everything was
held in common. Mother Earth herself, blessed and happy in her
devout foster sons, voluntarily opened her fruitful bosom. But a

in new arts but not wicked yet.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Soon this age was restless.

Now he has reached the lower world. Yonder is buried civil war
which long and wickedly has been carried on. Finally the wearied

was pronounced a god by the noble piety of the son, deified after
death, and worshipped in the temples. Stars will be destined for

my vengeance and anguish will turn to bitter destruction. Even
among the shades, the memory of my unnatural murder haunts me, and
I am oppressed by my unavenged spirit. Deservedly I recall the
deadly reward of the ship, the recompense for my ambition, and the
night when I deplored my shipwreck. I had vowed to lament the
violent death of my companions and my son’s cruel crime&mdash;he gave
me no opportunity to weep but repeated his wicked crime. Saved
from a watery grave, slain by the sword, defiled by wounds, among
my own household gods, I breathed my last, nor did I quench with my
blood my son’s hatred. The fierce tyrant rages at the very name
of mother. He desires to forget benefits; he destroys his mother’s
statues and titles of honor throughout the entire empire which
her ill-fated love gave to him to control for her punishment. My
murdered husband disturbs and threatens me even after my death, and
with flames seeks my hated features. He approaches and menaces me;
he imputes to me his son’s death and cenotaph; he demands the
assassin’s punishment. Cease thy entreaties. Expiation will soon

<p>Alas, how have my vows resulted? Whither have fury and the fates
led thee, my son, that the wrath of thy mother who perished by thy
crime may yield to such great misfortunes? Would that the savage
wild beasts had torn my vitals before I brought thee, a little
child, into the world and nourished thee. Would that guiltless
and without consciousness, my son, thou hadst perished. Would that
with me thou hadst seen the peaceful home of the lower world, thy
father, and thy ancestors, men of great renown. Now disgrace and
unending grief await them from thee, wicked son, and from me who
gave birth to such a monster. Why do I hesitate to hide my face

of the city lest thy great love for me excite the fierce wrath of
the emperor and be a source of misfortune to thee. This is not
the first wound my heart has known. I have felt deeper sorrows.
Today will end my anguish by death. I shall not be forced to see
the face of my cruel husband nor to enter the hated bridal chamber
of a slave. Sister of Augustus I shall be but not his wife.
Let only bitter punishment and fear of death be far from me. When
thou dost remember the crimes of this wicked man, canst thou in
thy misery hope for mercy? Long saved for these nuptials, an unfortunate
victim at last thou wilt fall. But why dost thou with tear-stained
cheeks look so often in terror at thy father’s palace?
Hasten to the city walls. Leave the blood-stained hall of the

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: See, a day, long foretold by any rumor, dawns.
Claudia is forced to leave dread Nero’s bridal room which now victorious
Poppaea occupies. Our loyalty and indignation are oppressed
by foreboding fear. Where now is the power of the Roman people
which often destroyed noble leaders, which once gave laws to an invincible
fatherland and fasces to worthy citizens, which commanded
war and peace, which conquered fierce tribes and imprisoned royal
captives? Behold the images of Poppaea and Nero gleam every where
before our sight.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> May the angry people dash to the ground the

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE OF POPPAEA</em>: Where art thou going from thy husband’s
bridal chamber, trembling daughter? Why in terror dost thou
seek concealment? Why dost thou weep? Surely the day dawns for
which we have sought by prayers and vows. Thou art married to
Caesar whom thy beauty captivated. Although thou art despised by
Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Venus, the mother of Love and greatest of all divinities,
has charmed the emperor and given him over to thee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Thou hast sat in lofty halls; thou hast rested upon royal couches.
The astonished senate saw thee with thy head adorned with the red
bridal veil, offering incense to the gods and sprinkling the sacred
altars with fragrant wine.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Close by thy side, honored among
the many happy omens of the citizens, showing joy in his haughty
bearing, the chief advanced. Thus did Peleus receive his wife

What has changed thee so suddenly? Tell me why thou dost grow
pale and weep?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>POPPAEA</em>: O, nurse, confused by the sad and fearful sights
of the past night, disturbed in mind, and deprived of feeling, I am
borne along. When joyful day gave place to gloomy stars and heaven
to night, clasped in the embrace of Nero, I could not sleep nor
rest for a long time. For a sad throng seemed to celebrate my
nuptials.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Roman matrons with flowing hair made doleful lamentations.
Often amid the terrible blasts of trumpets, my husband’s
cruel mother shook the blood-stained torch. When resistless fear
compelled me to follow her, the sundered earth opened before me in
a vast chasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Borne headlong, I see the marriage couches and I marvel at mine
in which, wearied, I reclined. I see my former husband and son coming
with a crowd of attendants. Crispinus<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> hastens to embrace
and kiss me. Just as he entered my dwelling, trembling Nero buried
the savage sword in his throat. Then overwhelming terror seized
me. Horrible fear shakes my body and brings anguish to my heart.
Anxiety has kept me speechless, but now thy faithful loyalty induces
me to speak. Alas, why do these departed spirits come from the
lower world to threaten me? Why have I witnessed the death of my
husband?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NURSE</em>: Whatever the restless activity of the mind considers, divine
consciousness silently and swiftly recalls in sleep.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Dost thou wonder that, clasped in the embrace of a new husband, thou
hast dreamed of thy former one, of the bridal room, and nuptial
couch? But on such a happy day, does it disturb thee that matrons
with flowing hair beat their breasts? They mourn the divorce of
Octavia among the sacred Penates of her brother and in the home of
her own ancestors. That torch which thou didst follow, borne aloft
by the hand of Augusta, predicts to thee a royal and envied name.
It foretells that the temples of the lower world will be thy eternal
couches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It does not predict war that thy chief buried the sword in his
throat, but it meant that he sheathed his sword in peace. Collect
thy thoughts, accept thy good fortune, I implore thee, and casting
aside all fear return to thy bridal apartments.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>POPPAEA</em>: I have determined to seek the shrines and sacred
altars, to propitiate the gods with sacrifices that terror and
astonishment may return upon my enemies. Offer up vows for me and
honor the god with devout prayers that the present state of affair
may continue.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: If gossiping rumor which now rules and again
abandons the stars, should tell of the true stratagems of Jove and
his pleasing loves&mdash;Jove who disguised as a swan had slept upon
the breast of Leda, and who, as a fierce bull, had carried the stolen
Europa through the waves&mdash;he will seek thy embraces, Poppaea, whom
he prefers to Leda and to Danae to whom he once descended in a
golden shower. Although Sparta may boast of Helen’s beauty and
Paris, the shepherd of Phrygia, may tell of his reward, Poppaea is
more beautiful than the Spartan Helen who caused such fierce wars
and overthrew the kingdom of Priam. But who rushes in with astonished
step, and what news does he bring with gasping breath?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>MESSENGER</em>: May the soldiers who guard the palace of the
emperor defend the hall which the furious people threaten. Behold,
the anxious cohorts bear aid to the city. The anger of the people
rashly aroused does not yield to fear but gathers strength and
force.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: What madness and terror distract his mind?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>MESSENGER</em>: The crowds of people are strongly attached

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: Tell what they have dared to do and by what counsel?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>MESSENGER</em>: The gods prepare to return to Claudia her
brother’s penates and couch, the empire which was her dowry.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: Whom does Poppaea now hold in allegiance?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>MESSENGER</em>: This rash favor inflames the mind of the people
and drives them headlong into raging madness. All the costly
marble and shining bronze images of Poppaea are broken and lie
prostrate overthrown by their savage swords. They drag her dismembered
statues along and after trampling them in the filthy mire, finally
destroy them entirely. My fears conceal their plans and
fierce deeds. They prepare to burn the palace of the emperor unless
he surrenders the new wife to their wrath and submissively
returns to Claudia her own penates. I shall not delay to carry
out the commands of the prefect, that Nero may know the movements
of his citizens.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: Cupid carries invincible weapons with which thou
dost vainly excite fierce wars. He will overwhelm thee with the
fires of passion with which he has often destroyed thunderbolts
and has drawn captive Jove from the sky. Thou wilt pay the penalty
with thy life. Glowing with passion, he is not patient nor
easily controlled. He commanded fierce Achilles to play the lyre; he
shattered the Greeks and Menelaus; he overturned the kingdom of
Priam; he destroyed royal cities. Now the mind fears what the relentless
power of the pitiless god brings.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: O, too lenient is the band of my soldiers and my
anger after such a great wrong, since civilian blood has not quenched
the torches burning for us and since Rome which produced
such a monster does not reek with the blood of the people. The
wicked crime of the common people deserves more severe punishment.
But let that woman who has stirred up rebellion among the citizens
and whom I have always suspected though she was wife and sister, too&mdash;let
her die by my wrath and let her extinguish my anger
in her own blood. Let the walls of the city perish in my
flames. Let disgraceful poverty, hunger, and cruel sorrow destroy
a hated nation. Great crowds corrupted by the prosperity of the
times run riot; moderation does not please it, nor can it endure a
peaceful reign, but it is borne hither by restless audacity, and is
hurled thither by its own temerity. Misfortune must govern it; a
heavy yoke must always crush it down lest it should dare to compare
me with former rulers and to conspire against my wife. Crushed
by fear of punishment, the people will learn to obey the will
of its own leader. But I see a man coming whose singular loyalty
and remarkable fidelity have placed him in command of my legions.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Will thy indignation prepare punishment for

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Let thy wrath, not our fear, restrain us.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: The first age which has deserved my wrath shall

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Disclose what thy anger demands so that we may

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: Dost thou hesitate to obey?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Why dost thou doubt my loyalty?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: Because thou art merciful to an enemy.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Should a woman receive this name?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: She incites crime.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Who is it who accuses her?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: Who can rule the frenzied crowd?</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: She who influenced it.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: I do not think anyone could.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: A woman whose mind is naturally inclined to evil
has inflamed their hearts with evil plans to injure me.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>PREFECT</em>: But she refused their aid.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>NERO</em>: But only that she might not be accused and that
fear of punishment might not overcome her weak strength. Retribution
will finally overtake the long condemned criminal. Hear my
plans and carry out my commands.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Order Octavia to be placed
on a ship and carried far away to a desert isle. There let her
be killed that the fear in my heart may subside.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: Indignation at the present instance forbids
mention of many examples of fickle fortune. The woman upon whom
the citizens wished to bestow the empire of the world, now they
see led weeping to bitter punishment and death. Well does contented
poverty conceal itself in humble dwellings. Often tempests shake
those homes or fortune overwhelms them.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Where dost thou lead me? What exile does the
tyrannical queen command for me, if, touched by my many misfortunes, she
grants me life? But if she intends to end my sorrow by
death, why does she begrudge me the pleasure of dying in my own
native land?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
But now I cannot hope to escape. In my misery, I see my brother’s
boat prepared for me.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Borne along in this vessel, once a wife, now
only a sister, driven from my own palace, sorrowfully I shall
drift away. Loyalty now has no divinity, nor are there gods above.
Gloomy Erinys rules in the world! What nightingale can return
soft plaintive notes to my weeping? I would like to escape my
sorrows on the uplifted pinions of a bird and borne aloft and far
away flee from the gloomy crowds of men and fierce carnage. Alone
in a deserted forest and suspended on a slender bough, I would
utter sad and mournful murmurs.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>CHORUS</em>: Mortals are ruled by fate, and no one can depend
upon the certainty of human life. A single portentous day brings
forth varying fortunes. May the many misfortunes which thy home
has endured strengthen thy mind. What is more cruel to thee than
destiny, Octavia? Thou, a mother worthy of many sons, daughter of
Agrippa, daughter-in-law of Augustus, and wife of Caesar<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> whose royal
name is illustrious in the entire world, soon a barren wife, thou

Yet after a time, although innocent, she falls by the
sword. Why was not thy former mother victorious who dear to her
husband and rich in children ruled the palace of the emperor?
She was submissive to her own servant and fell by the sword of a
rough soldier.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Why was such a mother of Nero permitted to hope
for divinity? Injured by the blows of the oarsmen but not fatally, mangled
by the sword, she perished, the victim of her cruel son.</p>

<p class="cindent"><em>OCTAVIA</em>: Alas, the cruel tyrant sends me to the sorrowing
shades in the lower world. Why do I in my misery vainly hesitate?
Hasten to the death which fate has bestowed upon thee. I
call to witness the immortal gods&mdash;What art thy doing in thy
madness? Cease to supplicate the gods who hate thee&mdash;I call to

with his infant son the name of Britannicus in honor of his
British victories. After the death of his third wife Messalina,
he married his own niece Agrippina 49 A.D. She influenced him to
set aside his own son Britannicus and to adopt her son Domitius
Ahenobarbus giving him the name of Nero. Having afterward shown
a disposition to return the succession to Britannicus, Claudius
was poisoned by Agrippina 54. Britannicus was poisoned in 55
and Agrippina murdered in 59 by order of Nero.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
